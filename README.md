A Visual Essay

Nan Goldin is an American photographer whose work resembles that of diary; her images and portraits are intimate, transgressive and often depicting queer communities of Boston and New York. I would like to explore her art, specifically her work titled, "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985) which consists of roughly 700 images, what makes her photos so gritty and raw, and her influence, both within the art world, and in modern culture.

"Cookie and Vittorio's Wedding, New York City" (1986) captures the intense joy and emotions that come forth on one of the most special moments of a couple's life. Goldin portfolio resembles that of a family album, her photos natural, unposed, and caked with intimacy of daily life. The pair photographed, Dorothy "Cookie" Mueller and Vittorio Scarpati, were both good friends of Goldin's and Cookie is seen photographed numerous times. Both had lived with HIV during the crisis in the 80s and eventually died within seven months of each other. Cookie's memory lives on in Goldin's photographs and exhibitions. Looking back, the photo exudes a sort of gloom that makes more sense in the context of their passing. It is cool, almost cold, and despite the joy and tears of joy, the pair knew before they had wed that their fight with AIDS would put an end to their marriage and ultimately their lives. Though their love is eternalized through the lens of Goldin.

Goldin sums up her style whilst talking about Cookie, saying in The New Yorker, “The photographs were intimate and then we were. I was outside of her and taking her picture let me in.” Their friendship grew over the years, progressively captured on film and, when Mueller was diagnosed, the pictures took on a historical meaning: not only was Goldin immortalising her friend, but also her experience of AIDS at a time when those with the disease were ostracised and misunderstood.Goldin sums up her style whilst talking about Cookie, saying in The New Yorker, “The photographs were intimate and then we were.
