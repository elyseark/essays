A Visual Essay

Nan Goldin is an American photographer whose work resembles that of diary; her images and portraits are intimate, transgressive and often depicting queer communities of Boston and New York. I would like to explore her art, specifically her work titled, "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985) which consists of roughly 700 images, what makes her photos so gritty and raw, and her influence, both within the art world, and in modern culture.

"Cookie and Vittorio's Wedding, New York City" (1986) captures the intense joy and emotions that come forth on one of the most special moments of a couple's life. Goldin portfolio resembles that of a family album, her photos natural, unposed, and caked with intimacy of daily life. The pair photographed, Dorothy "Cookie" Mueller and Vittorio Scarpati, were both good friends of Goldin's and Cookie is seen photographed numerous times. Both had lived with HIV during the crisis in the 80s and eventually died within months of each other. 

Goldin is known for her raw and intimate portrayals through the lens of her camera. Most of her subjects being friends, family, loved ones in her life. Her photographs, as a whole body of work, specifically "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency" acts as an autobiography of her life, including all of the prominent figures within it. Here, Cookie sheds tears of joy as a newlywed, though perhaps there is an undercurrent of sadness or fear, not knowing how long the pair might have together on this Earth. Goldin's best work is capturing the raw emotions, where her subjects are often unposed. This is her reality, this is her life, one that is unfiltered and authentic. The pair's love is locked in time, and the sheer emotion such a photo emits, is what sets her work apart. Cookie's memory lives on in Goldin's photographs and exhibitions. Looking back, the photo exudes a sort of gloom that makes more sense in the context of their passing. It is cool, almost cold, and despite the joy and tears of joy, the pair knew before they had wed that their fight with AIDS would put an end to their marriage and ultimately their lives. Though their love is eternalized through the lens of Goldin.The photo is almost void of warmth and consists of a rather cool, dark, chilling palette. This almost serves as a reminder of what the couple was facing privately behind closed doors. It further feels like a photo frozen in time, and after the pair passed, this photo is a true testament to their immortal love.

Annotations: (will make actual annotations later on) The photo is almost void of warmth and consists of a rather cool, dark, chilling palette.

Pink Carnations are often included in weddings and funerals and often symbolize gratitude, humility, as well as remembrance of someone after passing. Knowing how the pair's story ending, it feels almost an eerie inclusion to the photo of their wedding day.

Nan Goldin takes her work to another level in taking near candid photos and composing her camera in a way that makes it a true work of art. The smoke billowing from the city streets adds a dramatic, powerful effect, and she takes the shot at the perfect time. The smoke illuminates Cookie, and shows her almost as rising from the ashes, granting her power, true to her authenticity as a powerhouse, writer, party girl and purveyor of culture.

Goldin sums up her style whilst talking about Cookie, saying in The New Yorker, “The photographs were intimate and then we were. I was outside of her and taking her picture let me in.” Their friendship grew over the years, progressively captured on film and, when Mueller was diagnosed, the pictures took on a historical meaning. According to Girls on Tops, “not only was Goldin immortalising her friend, but also her experience of AIDS at a time when those with the disease were ostracised and misunderstood.” 

Goldin often explored dark themes of drug use, violence, sex, and loss, and the dark composition and lighting (or lack thereof) matches the dark subject matter. The heavy contrast between Cookie and her surroundings also highlight her as the focal point, bringing all the attention to her.
