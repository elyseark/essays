A Visual Essay

Nan Goldin is an American photographer whose work resembles that of diary; her images and portraits, intimate, transgressive and often depicting queer communities of Boston and New York. I would like to explore her art, specifically her work titled, "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985) which consists of roughly 700 images, what makes her photos so gritty and raw, and her influence, both within the art world, and in modern culture.
