# "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985): The Work of Nan Goldin

A Visual Essay

# "Untitled (Colette with feather, Boston)" (c. 1975), Nan Goldin

==Nan Goldin=={Q234279} is an influential American photographer and activist known for her deeply personal and raw documentation of human relationships and subcultural communities. She began photographing at age 15, later earning a BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1977. In 1978, she moved to New York, where she immersed herself in the city's bohemian and LGBTQ+ scenes, documenting her “extended family.”[^1] Her work resembles that of a diary; her images intimate, transgressive, and raw. I would like to examine her photography, specifically her work titled, =="The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985)=={Q1211204}, in the way it openly documents not only individual struggles and intimacies, but also broader cultural crises, curating a timeless conversation about love, survival, and the fight for visibility.

Renowned for her intensely personal snapshots of friends and acquaintances that have cemented her status as an icon in contemporary photography, Goldin describes her approach as part of the "dust and scratch school." This term reflects her emphasis on the content of her images, prioritizing it over process and technical precision. [^2]

# The Ballad of Sexual Dependency

Nan Goldin’s The Ballad of Sexual Dependency is a visceral and intimate chronicle of love, loss, and survival within the gritty subcultures of 1980s New York City. Comprising over 700 color slides accompanied by a haunting soundtrack, the forty-five-minute slideshow—titled after a song from Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s ==The Threepenny Opera=={Q212495}—serves as what Goldin calls “the diary I let people read.” [^3]

"Cookie and Vittorio's Wedding, New York City" (1986) captures the intense joy and emotions that come forth on one of the most special moments of a couple's life. Goldin portfolio resembles that of a family album, her photos natural, unposed, and caked with intimacy of daily life. The pair photographed, ==Dorothy "Cookie" Mueller=={Q5167087} and Vittorio Scarpati, were both good friends of Goldin's and Cookie is seen photographed numerous times. Both had lived with HIV during the crisis in the 80s and eventually died within months of each other. [^4] 

Goldin is known for her raw and intimate portrayals through the lens of her camera. Most of her subjects being friends, family, loved ones in her life. Her photographs, as a whole body of work, specifically "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency" acts as an autobiography of her life, including all of the prominent figures within it. Here, Cookie sheds tears of joy as a newlywed, though perhaps there is an undercurrent of sadness or fear, not knowing how long the pair might have together on this Earth. Goldin's best work is capturing the raw emotions, where her subjects are often unposed. This is her reality, this is her life, one that is unfiltered and authentic. The pair's love is locked in time, and the sheer emotion such a photo emits, is what sets her work apart. Cookie's memory lives on in Goldin's photographs and exhibitions. Looking back, the photo exudes a sort of gloom that makes more sense in the context of their passing. It is cool, almost cold, and despite the joy and tears of joy, the pair knew before they had wed that their fight with AIDS would put an end to their marriage and ultimately their lives. Though their love is eternalized through the lens of Goldin.

Annotations: (will make actual annotations later on) The photo is almost void of warmth and consists of a rather cool, dark, chilling palette. This almost serves as a reminder of what the couple was facing privately behind closed doors. It further feels like a photo frozen in time, and after the pair passed, this photo is a true testament to their immortal love. 

Pink Carnations are often included in weddings and funerals and often symbolize gratitude, humility, as well as remembrance of someone after passing. Knowing how the pair's story ending, it feels almost an eerie inclusion to the photo of their wedding day.

Nan Goldin takes her work to another level in taking near candid photos and composing her camera in a way that makes it a true work of art. The smoke billowing from the city streets adds a dramatic, powerful effect, and she takes the shot at the perfect time. The smoke illuminates Cookie, and shows her almost as rising from the ashes, granting her power, true to her authenticity as a powerhouse, writer, party girl and purveyor of culture.

Goldin sums up her style whilst talking about Cookie, saying in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/04/nan-goldins-the-ballad-of-sexual-dependency), “The photographs were intimate and then we were. I was outside of her and taking her picture let me in.” Their friendship grew over the years, progressively captured on film and, when Mueller was diagnosed, the pictures took on a historical meaning. According to Girls on Tops, “not only was Goldin immortalising her friend, but also her experience of AIDS at a time when those with the disease were ostracised and misunderstood.” 

Goldin often explored dark themes of drug use, violence, sex, and loss, and the dark composition and lighting (or lack thereof) matches the dark subject matter. The heavy contrast between Cookie and her surroundings also highlight her as the focal point, bringing all the attention to her.

# Beyond the *Ballad*: Other Influential Exhibits 

***Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls* (2004)**

Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls is a multi-screen installation combining video and still photography to explore familial relationships, addiction, and personal tragedy.

Goldin’s deeply personal film about her sister Barbara, who died by suicide at eighteen. [Gagosian](https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2024/nan-goldin-sisters-saints-sibyls/) describes how the film begins with the story of ==Saint Barbara=={Q192816}, a Christian martyr who defied her parents and was punished, shown as a three-channel projection like a religious triptych. This story mirrors Barbara’s life, as she faced harsh judgment and institutionalization in the 1950s for rebelling against societal norms about race, gender, and sexuality. Barbara’s death had a lasting impact on Goldin, shaping her art and life. The film also reflects on Goldin’s own struggles with addiction and pain, showing how life is a mix of change, loss, and finding connection. [^5]

Barbara and her suicide left an indelible mark on Goldin’s life and work, where *Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls*, is just one example. [Dazed Magazine](https://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/34062/1/your-ultimate-guide-to-nan-goldin)  highlights Goldin’s introduction of *The Ballad of Sexual Dependency*-dedicated to her sister- where Goldin recalls, “I was eleven when my sister committed suicide. This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early 60s, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behaviour, beyond control. By the time she was 18, she saw that her only way to get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will.”

***Memory Lost* (2019)**

*Memory Lost* explores the devestating effects of drug addiction on memory and identity. It feels like a visual diary dissolving over time, highlighting the instability of personal histories. [Marian Goodman Gallery](https://www.artsy.net/show/marian-goodman-gallery-nan-goldin-memory-lost/info), who first exhibited this work, describes how Goldin reflects on the distortion and erasure of memory caused by addiction through a haunting sequence of intimate, archival images. The work is accompanied by a deeply emotive score composed by Mica Levi, with additional contributions from CJ Calderwood and Soundwalk Collective, enhancing the emotional intensity of the visual narrative. Marian Goodman Gallery further notes that for the first time in her career, Goldin has presented stills from the slideshow as ==dye sublimation prints=={Q1477251} on aluminum, emphasizing the unpredictability of photography in her earlier work, where technical flaws often revealed subconscious meanings. This exhibit is considered one of Goldin’s most moving and personal projects, capturing a profound journey through addiction and memory.
