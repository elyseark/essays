# Nan Goldin
==Nan Goldin=={Q234279} is an influential American photographer and activist known for her deeply personal and raw documentation of human relationships and subcultural communities. She began photographing at age 15, later earning a BFA from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1977. In 1978, she moved to New York, where she immersed herself in the city's bohemian and LGBTQ+ scenes, documenting her “extended family.” Her work resembles that of a diary; her images intimate, transgressive, and raw. I would like to examine her photography, specifically her work titled, =="*The Ballad of Sexual Dependency*," (1985)=={Q1211204}, in the way it openly documents not only individual struggles and intimacies, but also broader cultural crises, curating a timeless conversation about love, survival, and the fight for visibility. 

# *The Ballad of Sexual Dependency*
.ve-media https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/121104/manifest.json

The Ballad of Sexual Dependency is a visceral and intimate chronicle of love, friendship, sex, drug use, domestic life, loss, and survival within the gritty subcultures of mostly New York City. First debuting at the Mudd Club in Lower Manhattan in 1979, The Ballad first appeared as a slide show of over 700 film images, over a fifteen-year period, showcasing Goldin's world during the late 1970s, 80s, and early 90s. Since its initial inception, the slideshow has been updated and edited on several occasions, and has manifested from video into a published book. [^1] 

The 700 color slides accompanied by a haunting soundtrack, the forty-five-minute slideshow—titled after a song from Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s ==*The Threepenny Opera*=={Q212495}—serves as what Goldin calls “the diary I let people read.” [^2]

# Themes of Intimacy and Relationships

Goldin is known for her raw and intimate portrayals. Most of her subjects being friends, family, loved ones in her life. Her photos, reflect a deep connection to the moments and people she captured, highlighting the relationships she shared with her subjects. She wasn't just observing–she was actively present and involved in the world she documented.

Many of Goldin's photos chronicle people in vulnerable and intimate moments like this one here, a pair locking lips. Other photos highlight naked bodies, bruises and black eyes, a couple in bed together–all of which are some of life's most intimate moments. 

Goldin's use of chaotic composition and techniques like ==blur=={Q29950313} and ==snapshot=={Q1758746} enhances the authenticity of her work, immersing viewers in the raw, unpolished realities of subcultures often overlooked. These methods capture the intensity and transience of her subjects’ lives, emphasizing the emotional depth and spontaneity of relationships. The lack of conventional aesthetics in her photos adds to their authenticity, reinforcing the intimate and unfiltered nature of her work, where the focus is on real, lived experiences as opposed to perfect, posed composition. [^3]

Goldin's Ballad photos use flash and saturated colors to evoke emotion and reflect her nocturnal lifestyle, often creating a claustrophobic atmosphere. Featuring one or two key subjects—usually her friends and close acquaintances and the relations between them—the flash highlights intimate details and expressions, allowing each image to tell a story. [^4] 

# LGBTQ+ Community, Marginalized Identities, and the AIDS Epidemic 

Goldin started her photography documenting drag queens. Since then, much of her work has centered on portraying her friends in the LGBTQ+ community. Goldin herself was apart of this community, going back to the idea that she is directly involved in the work she produces. In *David with Butch Crying at Tin Pan Alley*, she captures raw emotion in a way that feels voyeuristic, yet the photo leaves the source of the tears—whether joy or sorrow—ambiguous, inviting viewers to create their own interpretations. [^5]

David Klein Martins writes in his article, [*Nan Goldin’s The Other Side: Creating A Gender-Free Space for a Queer Futurity*](https://www.estrema.letras.ulisboa.pt/ojs/index.php/estrema/article/view/55), that "Goldin has been a pioneer spokesperson for the queer community and particularly for the trans and drag movements, in a time in which gendercrossers were completely ostracized, even within the gay community."

Many of those in the LGBTQ+ community dealt with the ==AIDS=={Q12199} crisis at the time. Her work often reflects this point in history, and her portraits of those suffering from AIDS, humanize the disease and provides visibility to these marginalized individuals.

Nan Goldin’s work often explores dark themes like drug use, violence, sex, and loss, with her dim compositions reflecting these heavy subjects. Many of her subjects, including close friends ==Dorothy "Cookie" Mueller=={Q5167087} and Vittorio Scarpati, were part of the LGBTQ+ community and were living with HIV in the 1980s. 

Cookie and Vittorio were photographed by Goldin on their wedding day, before their deaths, just months apart. The poignant image shows Cookie in tears on her wedding day—joyful yet tinged with the sadness of knowing their time was limited. When looking back, the photo exudes a sort of gloom that makes more sense in the context of their passing. [^6] 

Goldin’s ability to capture such layered, authentic moments defines her work, which resembles a family album, unfiltered and deeply personal. This is her reality, this is her life, one that is unfiltered and authentic–this is what sets her work apart. 

The smoke illuminates Cookie, and shows her almost as rising from the ashes, granting her power, true to her authenticity as a powerhouse, writer, party girl and purveyor of culture. Reflecting on her friendship with Cookie, Goldin noted in [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/04/nan-goldins-the-ballad-of-sexual-dependency), “The photographs were intimate and then we were. I was outside of her and taking her picture let me in.” Her images not only immortalizes Cookie or the pair's bond but also depicts the realities of a community navigating love and loss during the AIDS epidemic, preserving their memory in her exhibitions. 
 
# A Focus on Dependency

In *The Ballad*, "dependency" refers to the complex, intertwined relationships and emotional reliance people have on one another. It captures the ways love, desire, and intimacy can be both nurturing and destructive, reflecting the vulnerabilities and struggles that come with human connection. [^7] 

Listen to Nan describe it in her own words.

# Beyond *The Ballad*: Other Influential Exhibits 

***Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls* (2004)**

Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls is a multi-screen installation combining video and still photography to explore familial relationships, addiction, and personal tragedy.

Goldin’s deeply personal film about her sister Barbara, who died by suicide at eighteen. [Gagosian](https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2024/nan-goldin-sisters-saints-sibyls/) describes how the film begins with the story of ==Saint Barbara=={Q192816}, a Christian martyr who defied her parents and was punished, shown as a three-channel projection like a religious triptych. This story mirrors Barbara’s life, as she faced harsh judgment and institutionalization in the 1950s for rebelling against societal norms about race, gender, and sexuality. Barbara’s death had a lasting impact on Goldin, shaping her art and life. The film also reflects on Goldin’s own struggles with addiction and pain, showing how life is a mix of change, loss, and finding connection. [^8]

Barbara and her suicide left an indelible mark on Goldin’s life and work, where *Sisters, Saints, & Sibyls*, is just one example. [*Dazed Magazine*](https://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/34062/1/your-ultimate-guide-to-nan-goldin)  highlights Goldin’s introduction of *The Ballad of Sexual Dependency*–dedicated to her sister–where Goldin recalls, “I was eleven when my sister committed suicide. This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject...I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her destruction. Because of the times, the early 60s, women who were angry and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behaviour, beyond control...It was an act of immense will.”

***Memory Lost* (2019)**

*Memory Lost* explores the devestating effects of drug addiction on memory and identity through a ==single channel=={Q48774253} HD video projection with audio. [*Marian Goodman Gallery*](https://www.artsy.net/show/marian-goodman-gallery-nan-goldin-memory-lost/info), who first exhibited this work, describes how Goldin reflects on the distortion and erasure of memory caused by addiction through a haunting sequence of intimate, archival images. The work is accompanied by a deeply emotive score composed by Mica Levi, with additional contributions from CJ Calderwood and Soundwalk Collective, enhancing the emotional intensity of the visual narrative. Marian Goodman Gallery further notes that for the first time in her career, Goldin has presented stills from the slideshow as ==dye sublimation prints=={Q1477251} on aluminum, emphasizing the unpredictability of photography in her earlier work, where technical flaws often revealed subconscious meanings. This exhibit is considered one of Goldin’s most moving and personal projects, capturing a profound journey through addiction and memory.
