Nan Goldin is an American photographer whose work resembles that of diary; her images and portraits are intimate, transgressive and often depicting queer communities of Boston and New York. I would like to explore her art, specifically her work titled, "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency," (1985) which consists of roughly 700 images, what makes her photos so gritty and raw, and her influence, both within the art world, and in modern culture.

"Cookie and Vittorio's Wedding, New York City" (1986) captures the intense joy and emotions that come forth on one of the most special moments of a couple's life. Goldin portfolio resembles that of a family album, her photos natural, unposed, and caked with intimacy of daily life. The pair photographed, Dorothy "Cookie" Mueller and Vittorio Scarpati, were both good friends of Goldin's and Cookie is seen photographed numerous times. Both had lived with HIV during the crisis in the 80s and eventually died within months of each other.
